If **platform.stgtelematics.com** does not have an API, you have a few options to automate sending tracking data to Google Sheets:  

### **1. Check for Hidden API**  
- Some platforms have hidden APIs. You can inspect network requests in **Chrome DevTools (F12 > Network tab)** to see if data is coming from an API.  
- If you find API endpoints, you can use them with Google Apps Script to send data to Google Sheets.  

### **2. Web Scraping (If No API Exists)**  
- If no API is available, you can use **Python with Selenium** to extract data from the website and update Google Sheets.  
- Alternative: Use **Google Apps Script** to scrape data if the website allows it.  

### **3. Browser Automation with RPA**  
- Use **UI automation tools like AutoIt, Selenium, or Power Automate** to open the website, extract data, and insert it into Google Sheets.  

### **4. Using Google Sheets Scripts (Manual Sync)**  
- If you manually copy-paste data, you can use **Google Apps Script** to format and process it automatically.  

#### **Best Option?**  
If platform.stgtelematics.com does not provide an API, web scraping or browser automation is the only way. Let me know if you need a script for any method. ðŸš€
